# PacMen-Exercise
It consists in generating different items/objects upon request by clicking a button. These objects or PacMen can start moving, changing acceleration, and also changing direction when hitting a wall.

## How to run:
Download the compressed file containing all the files in the repository, extract it and open the index.hmtl file with a web browser. You may modify the content of the files depending on the desired outcome.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Have the images change when they hit one of the wall. Perhaps change colors too.
